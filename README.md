# HyperOnMDP
Verifying Hyperproperties on MDP

This script uses python 3. It is mainly dependent on. :

-- Stormpy(https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/)

The above library has its own dependencies which need to be resolved first. Using an IDE (Pycharm, in my case) helped in easy resolution of the problem.

The arguments that the script needs are as follows:

1) Path of the model file

2) Property used on the model

The details of the experiments have been provided in https://github.com/oreohere/HyperOnMDP/blob/master/Experiments.txt
