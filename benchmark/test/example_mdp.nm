// MDP for testing if fairness holds for all sets of traces of this MDP.

// This is the mdp input into HyperProb to be evaluated with hyperproperties

// This model should be evaluated as unfair as there is an explicit bias against minorities where their college 
// rank is increased and puts them at a disadvantage of getting hired.
